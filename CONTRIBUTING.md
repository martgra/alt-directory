# Contributing to alt-directory

Thank you for considering contributing to alt-directory! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.3.1 or higher
- Git
- Docker (for devcontainer)

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git fork alt-directory
   cd alt-directory
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Optional: Use devcontainer**

   Open the project in VS Code and click "Reopen in Container" when prompted.

4. **Create a new branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Running the Project

```bash
# Development mode with watch
bun run dev

# Production build
bun run build
bun start
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run linter
bun run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
bun run lint:fix

# Check code formatting
bun run format:check

# Auto-format code
bun run format

# Find unused code
bun run knip
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown

### File Organization

```
src/
├── index.ts           # Entry point
├── lib/               # Reusable utilities
└── types/             # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Imports

- Imports are automatically sorted by `eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort`
- Order: Node built-ins → External packages → Internal modules

### Git Hooks

Pre-commit hooks automatically run:

- ESLint (auto-fix)
- Prettier (auto-format)
- Secret detection

**Important:** If the hook makes changes, they are **not** automatically staged. Review the changes, stage them, and commit again.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** - Update README.md if you change functionality
2. **Run all checks** - Ensure linting, formatting, and build pass
3. **Write clear commit messages** - Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

   ```
   feat: add new feature
   fix: resolve bug in X
   docs: update README
   refactor: restructure Z
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Reference any related issues
   - Describe what changed and why
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

5. **Address review feedback** - Respond to comments and make requested changes

## Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Example:**
